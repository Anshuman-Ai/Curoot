Figma for Supply Chain Platform — Database Relationships
Version: 1.0.0
Status: Production Ready

1. Overview

This document defines all relational mappings, cardinality, and data flow dependencies across the PostgreSQL schema.

The system follows a multi-tenant, graph-based architecture with strict 1-Hop data isolation, enforced through:

Foreign key constraints
Row-Level Security (RLS)
No cross-org joins for deeper tiers
2. Core Design Principles
2.1 Multi-Tenancy
Root table: organizations
Every table includes organization_id
Enforced via RLS
2.2 Graph Model
Nodes → supply_chain_nodes
Edges → node_edges
Directed relationships only
2.3 1-Hop Isolation
No direct FK to Tier-2+ suppliers
Upstream data passed via:
abstracted_payload (JSONB)
2.4 Soft Delete Pattern
deleted_at IS NULL → active records
3. High-Level Domain Relationships

1 → N communication_logs
4.2 organization_members

FKs:

organization_id → organizations.id

Cardinality:

Many members belong to one organization
A user can belong to multiple organizations
4.3 supply_chain_nodes (Core Graph Node)

FKs:

organization_id → organizations.id
partner_org_id → organizations.id (nullable)

Relationships:

1 → N node_edges (as source)
1 → N node_edges (as target)
1 → N telemetry_events
1 → N disruption_alerts
1 → N node_invitations
1 → N rfp_requests
4.4 node_edges (Graph Edges)

FKs:

organization_id → organizations.id
source_node_id → supply_chain_nodes.id
target_node_id → supply_chain_nodes.id

Cardinality:

Many edges per node
Directed relationship

Constraints:

No self-loop (source != target)
Unique edge per (source, target, type)
4.5 community_templates

FKs:

published_by_org → organizations.id

Relationships:

1 → N template_nodes
1 → N rfp_requests
4.6 template_nodes

FKs:

template_id → community_templates.id

Purpose:

Defines node structure inside templates
4.7 node_invitations

FKs:

organization_id → organizations.id
target_node_id → supply_chain_nodes.id
accepted_org_id → organizations.id

Lifecycle Flow:

Invite Created → Accepted → Organization Created → Node Activated
4.8 rfp_requests

FKs:

organization_id → organizations.id
target_node_id → supply_chain_nodes.id
template_id → community_templates.id

Constraints:

Max 2 submissions/day per node
Cooldown enforced
4.9 ingestion_jobs

FKs:

organization_id → organizations.id

Relationships:

1 → 1 mcp_containers
4.10 mcp_containers

FKs:

organization_id → organizations.id (UNIQUE)
ingestion_job_id → ingestion_jobs.id

Cardinality:

One container per organization
4.11 telemetry_events (Time-Series)

FKs:

node_id → supply_chain_nodes.id
organization_id → organizations.id

Characteristics:

Partitioned by recorded_at
High-volume append-only
4.12 disruption_alerts

FKs:

node_id → supply_chain_nodes.id (nullable)
edge_id → node_edges.id (nullable)
organization_id → organizations.id

Rule:

Either node_id OR edge_id must exist
4.13 macro_environment_signals

No direct FK relationships

Linked logically via:

country_code
4.14 tradeoff_analyses

FKs:

organization_id → organizations.id
current_node_id → supply_chain_nodes.id
alternative_node_id → supply_chain_nodes.id
disruption_alert_id → disruption_alerts.id

Relationships:

1 → N tradeoff_metrics
4.15 tradeoff_metrics

FKs:

analysis_id → tradeoff_analyses.id

Constraint:

One row per metric type per analysis
4.16 messages

FKs:

sender_org_id → organizations.id
recipient_org_id → organizations.id
node_id → supply_chain_nodes.id (optional)
4.17 communication_logs

FKs:

5. Critical Relationship Patterns
5.1 Graph Traversal
supply_chain_nodes
    ↓
node_edges (source → target)
    ↓
supply_chain_nodes

Used for:

Route discovery
Dependency mapping
Risk propagation
5.2 Event Flow
telemetry_events
    ↓
disruption_alerts
    ↓
tradeoff_analyses
    ↓
tradeoff_metrics
5.3 Onboarding Flow
community_templates
    ↓
template_nodes
    ↓
rfp_requests
    ↓
node_invitations
    ↓
supply_chain_nodes
5.4 Data Ingestion Flow
ingestion_jobs
    ↓
mcp_containers
    ↓
telemetry_events
    ↓
supply_chain_nodes (updates)
6. Referential Integrity Rules
Rule	Description
Tenant Isolation	All rows scoped by organization_id
No Cross-Org Edges	Enforced in node_edges
Soft Delete	Never physically delete core data
Append-Only Logs	audit_log, communication_logs
Partitioned Tables	telemetry_events, audit_log
7. Performance Considerations
High-volume tables:
telemetry_events → partitioned
audit_log → partitioned
Indexes:
GIN → JSONB fields
GiST → geospatial (location)
BRIN → time-series
Query Patterns:
Always filter by organization_id
Use partial indexes for active records
8. Summary
